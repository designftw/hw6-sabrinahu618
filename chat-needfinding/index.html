	<h2>Interviewing</h2>
	<b>Interview #1</b>
	<ul>
		<li>
			I use iMessage the most due to convenience (pre-installed on iPhone) and Facebook Messenger because
			many MIT students use it.
		</li>
		<li>
			There are an excessive amount of features that are not used.
		</li>
		<li>
			Use different apps for other purposes: Facebook Messenger for college clubs and Discord for specific people
		</li>
		<li>
			When making plans to eat with friends, it was difficult to get an Uber and the wait ended up being so long
			for the
			restaurant we originally wanted to go to that we had to find a different place.
		</li>
		<li>
			I get a lot of my inspiration for food from TikTok videos.
		</li>
		<li>
			I usually just default to Happy Lamb Hotpot but if my friends want to go somewhere else I'll tag along and
			that's how I learn about new places.
		</li>
		<li>
			I like to take pictures of my food but I don't have an Instagram to share them on.
		</li>
		<li>
			Some features I might like to see are a real-time feature of how full a restaurant is and the wait time
			predictions.
			Food reviews are important too because it gives more information than just statistics on an app, which is
			why Yelp is so helpful.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<b>Interview #2</b>
	<ul>
		<li>
			I primarily use iMessage as my main messaging system because most people have iPhones and it supports SMS.
		</li>
		<li>
			I wish that iMessage allowed me to search for content in the chat. I need to scroll up to find something in
			the conversation.
		</li>
		<li>
			I've been frustrated with the reply feature in iMessage. You need to long press and select to reply whereas
			other apps let you swipe to apply.
			Also when you reply, it makes a new thread and you need to click to see what messages were in that thread so
			it's not practical.
		</li>
		<li>
			I use different apps because different people use Instagram DMs or FB Messenger. Whatever they use, I'll
			use.
		</li>
		<li>
			When making plans to eat with friends in person, we'll look at Google Maps to see where we should go and how
			far it is. When
			we aren't together, we just text about it. This can lead to setbacks in planning with abilities to meet up.
			It's hard to overlap the times to see when all of us can meet up. When giving ideas of where to go,
			we need to open a separate browser to see how far it is.
		</li>
		<li>
			Sometimes my friends mention or post a restaurant they went to on social media and that's how I find out
			about new places. I also like eating out a lot,
			especially Asian food.
		</li>
		<li>
			Sometimes I'll post a picture of my food on my Instagram story.
		</li>
		<li>
			My friends have food Instagrams that I check when we have no idea where to eat. Usually my friends and I
			default to restaurants we know are good and close-by.
		</li>
		<li>
			When planning around a food trip, I'd like for it to pin the location on a map whenever you enter the name
			of a restaurant and
			suggested places in the proximity. I also want it to show basic information about the place to help decide.
			It'd be good to be able
			to syn timeframes to Google Calendar to see when everyone is available.

	<b>Interview #3</b>
	<ul>
		<li>
			I use Signal the most because they advertise they are very safe and secure with end-to-end encryption.
		</li>
		<li>
			I wish that Signal let me easily annotate a picture and send it back to the person. I need to download the
			image,
			draw on it with another app, and then send it back, which is pretty annoying.
		</li>
		<li>
			I've been frustrated with how slow this app can be. It takes 1 or 2 seconds to register as sent and if you
			leave within that
			short time frame, it fails to send the message, which can be a big problem.
		</li>
		<li>
			I use Slack when talking to coworkers and WhatsApp or Messenger when talking to relatives or friends,
			depending on what they have.
		</li>
		<li>
			I usually use Messenger to ask when my friends are free to get food. I wish there was a way to share your
			availability quickly, because
			we need to type it out and it's not very convenient. We can use an external tool like When2meet but that
			means I need to leave the app. It's also
			sometimes annoying because people might forget that we made plans, or there was a misunderstanding of what
			the actual plan is. My friend once showed up
			in gym attire because he thought we were going to the gym.
		</li>
		<li>
			I default to Spring Shabu Shabu or Olive Garden for special events, but it'd be nice to have a way to
			explore other places easily.
		</li>
		<li>
			Whenever I get to a restaurant and can't decide, I pull up Yelp to see what food looks good.
		</li>
		<li>
			I also consider if there is good dessert in proximity, like Mochinut is near Seoul Toppaki.
		</li>
		<li>
			I'd prioritize geographic information because I'll choose a place that is close enough and satisfies a
			particular criter of places I'm happy to go to. It'd
			be nice if I didn't need to leave the app to check information and also be able to see if a restaurant is
			open, dog friendly, and not too expensive.
		</li>
